# ðŸ“Š COVID-19 DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATIONðŸ“Š 

This project is a data analysis and visualization notebook focused on understanding the impact of COVID-19 across different countries using datafrom  **Our Work in Data**.
It compares case trends, death rates, and vaccination progress in selected countries, and includes an interactive global map for exploration. 

---

## Project Objectives 
- To analyze and visualize the spread and impact of COVID-19 in selected in selected countries.
- To compare trends in total cases, death rates, and vaccination progress  over time.
- To create an interactivi global map to examine COVID-19 statistics by country.
- To practice using data science tools for real-world data analysis.

# ðŸ§°Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **pandas** - for data manipulation
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** - for static visualizations
- **plotly.express** - for interactive visualizations
- **ipywidgets** - for UI interactivity
- **IPython.display** - for dynamic notebook display features

  ## How to Run or View the Project
  1. **Download the Dataset**
     - Go to [Our World in Data - COVID-19 dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases)
     - Download the file 'owid-covid-data.csv'
     - place it in the same folder as the notebook 'covid.ipynb'
 2. **Install Required Libraries**
 Run the following commands in your terminal or notebook:
``` bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly ipywidgets
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetnbextension

 3. Open and Run the Notebook
- Open covid.ipynb using jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Run all the cells from top to bottom.

## Insights and Reflections
- The total number of cases and vaccinations vary widely across countries, with the United Staes leading in both
- Deat rates show that early in the pandemic, fatality was more common before widespread testing and treatment were available.
- Kenya shows a lower case count overall, possibly due to the lower testing rates or underreporting
- The interactive map provides a powerful way to visually compare COVID-19 metrics accross the globe.

This project highlighted the importance of data cleaning and visualization in making large-scale data understable and useful
for comparison and decision-making.
